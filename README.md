### Hello! My name is Kerri McMahon.
### I am a Software Engineer who specializes in backend systems.

I've had a pretty interesting path so far. Here's a brief summary if you are interested in hearing more about my background!

I started out my career conducting research at Brookhaven National Laboratory concerning fault tolerance in the polyhedral compilation space. This research was selected for presentation at the MIT/IEEE URTC in 2019, and also helped qualify me for the [ACM/UPE Scholar of the Year award.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3362037)
 After my undergraduate studies, I was enrolled to continue this research as a PhD candidate at the University of Oklahoma.

While I had a lot of passion for this work, I realized i was truly happy as an individual contributer within the industry. I pivoted and took my first software engineering role at Intelligent Product Solutions, where I gained experience in a variety of spaces like backend engineering, IoT microcontroller development, mobile app development, and more.
