### Hello! My name is Kerri McMahon. 
### Here's a more in depth summary of my path so far if you are interested in hearing more about me and my background!

I am a software engineer who specializes in backend systems with just over 3 years of experience.

I started out my career conducting research at Brookhaven National Laboratory concerning fault tolerance in the polyhedral compilation space. This research was selected for presentation at the MIT/IEEE URTC in 2019, and also helped qualify me for the [ACM/UPE Scholar of the Year award.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3362037) After my undergraduate studies, I was enrolled to continue this research as a PhD candidate at the University of Oklahoma.

While I had a lot of passion for this work, I realized I was truly happy as an individual contributer within the industry. I pivoted and took my first software engineering role at Intelligent Product Solutions, where I gained experience in a variety of spaces like backend engineering, IoT microcontroller development, mobile app development, and more. 

The most notable project I worked on was a project called [Spiriocast](https://www.steinway.com/spirio/spirio-r/spiriocast), where I contributed to the various live video streaming services that powered the product. I worked a lot with low level video processing (HLS, MKV, Kinesis Video Streams,), microservices architrcure, message queues (ZeroMQ), and API development. I worked with an incredibly talented team to bring that product to official release.

Currently, I am a backend engineer in the gaming industry, where I contribute to distributed online multiplayer systems for over 180 million players around the world. I've been a video game lover my whole life, and to be able to contribute to products that have had such a concrete spot in my life has been nothing but fun and an honor! I also get to work really closely with distributed systems, which are incredibly interesting to me.

Thanks for reading!

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Distributed Systems - I'm currently reading [Distributed Systems by Maarten Van Steen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9081540637?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449373321?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
- Go - I am currently using Java and Python on the job but love Go and have used it in the past. I am trying to keep my skills sharp as you can see below!
